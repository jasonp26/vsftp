#Do the following to check if you have the firewall on or off

>>> sudo ufw status

#If your firewall is inactive you can enable it with this command

>>> sudo ufw enable

#You should see a similar output

Status: active

#LINES 25 and 26 are the important ones related to the VSFTPD damon.  In the above example I have an enabled firewall
and i had to allow the service through.  To do this you must type:

>>> sudo ufw allow 21

#That will now allow you to gain access to your VSFTP service.  However it may need more hardening if you wish to only
#allow access from a specific IP Range/Address

#For a full list of the Ubuntu Firewall Commands you could type a syntax error and it will show itself, like:

>>> sudo ufw command
